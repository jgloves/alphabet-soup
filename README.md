## Game Logic

This is a very cute word scrabble game for kids.

## Approach

This game was written in Full-Stack JavaScript. For the front end, HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript was used. Drawing on the Canvas and game logic areimplemented without any libraries or frameworks. For the back-end, Express was used as a simple Node wrapper.

## Work in Progress

The cake is currently being baked and coming out of the oven soon!
