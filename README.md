## Game Logic

This is a very cute unscrambling word game for kids. The idea is to guess the scrambled word. The game has various levels and themes to make it super fun for kids.

## Approach

This game is written in Full-Stack JavaScript. For the front end, HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript is used. Drawing on the Canvas and game logic are implemented without any libraries or frameworks. For the back-end, Express is used as a simple Node wrapper.

## Work in Progress

The cake is currently being baked and coming out of the oven soon!
